ACStore, or Attribute Container Storage, provides a stand-alone implementation
to read and write plaso storage files.

ACStore, originates from the Plaso project [https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso].
It was largely rewritten and made into a stand-alone project to provide more
flexibility and allow other projects to make use of the plaso storage objects.

ACStore is currently developed and maintained by:
* Daniel White
* Joachim Metz
